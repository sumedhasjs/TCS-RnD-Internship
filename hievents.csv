The vessel Low Speed Chase, a 12 metre racing sailboat with a crew of eight, was one of 49 yachts competing on Saturday in a race around South Farallon Island, part of a rugged, sparsely populated chain offshore from San Francisco.
Officials said trouble began as the vessel rounded South Farallon Island on Saturday afternoon. A large wave initially swept four crew members into the ocean and when those remaining aboard tried to turn the craft around, another wave pushed the boat onto rocks, where it foundered. Local media said the second wave tossed three more people into the water.
Air units from the coast guard and California Air National Guard lifted off after receiving an emergency transmission from a satellite beacon on the Low Speed Chase, as well as a mayday radio call from a nearby yacht, officials said.
The accident came two weeks after a monster wave smashed into an Australian yacht taking part in a round-the-world race. Four crew members were hurt in that accident, which took place 400 nautical miles off the California coast, and the coast guard had to be called in to help. No one was killed.
Shortly after Saturday's accident, helicopter crews quickly used litter baskets and motorized winches to rescue three sailors, said Levi Read, a US coast guard spokesman.
The rescuers also recovered the body of Marc Kasanin (46) of Belvedere, California, who was identified late on Sunday in a release from the San Francisco Yacht Club, where the Low Speed Chase was based.
Mr Read had earlier said the prospects for surviving frigid ocean waters or holding onto the rocky shoals and cliffs of the Farallones depended on the missing sailors' physical fitness, size and clothing.
""The people who were rescued had on cold-weather gear and inflatable life vests,"" he said.
Ed Lynch, the yacht club's director, said the three rescued sailors were ""all pretty shaken up"" and taken to San Francisco General Hospital. Two were treated and released on Saturday and one remained hospitalized yesterday with a fractured leg.

At least two people, one of them the bus driver, were injured in the attack near the flashpoint city of Homs, reports say.
The passengers were returning from the Hajj - the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia - reports say.
Private news agency Dogan showed images of the bus with one of its side windows broken inside Turkey.
""We confirm that an attack took place in Syria,"" a foreign ministry official told AFP news agency, without giving any further information, but reiterated Turkey's warning to its citizens not to visit Syria.
Tensions have been running high between Syria and Turkey as Ankara has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on anti-government protests in his country.
Clashes again erupt in Cairo as Egypt's health ministry confirms at least 20 people have died and 1,750 have been wounded in a weekend of violence.

article-11554.xml,"A strong magnitude-6.7 earthquake shook central Chile late Monday, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of a stretch of coastline and causing hundreds of people in the capital to flee buildings in panic.
There were no reports of major damage, but authorities in the port city of Valparaiso said a 72-year-old man died of a heart attack during the quake. The earthquake was felt for almost a minute in Valparaiso and the capital, Santiago.
The US Geological Survey initially put the quake's magnitude at 6.5 but later raised it to 6.7. Its epicenter was 26 miles northeast of Valparaiso, and it had a depth of 23 miles. It struck just minutes before midnight local time Monday.
The Chilean navy's hydrographic and oceanographic service discounted the possibility of a tsunami, but authorities maintained an order for people to move to higher ground along a roughly 500-mile stretch of coastline running from the city of Constitucion to Tongoy, north of the capital. Thousands of people were later allowed to return home, said Deputy Interior Secretary Rodrigo Ubilla.
The quake knocked out power and telephone service in various parts of Santiago, but the National Emergency Office of the Interior Ministry said that it had received no reports of major damage or injuries so far.
There were reports of rockslides on a highway outside of Santiago, and residents of Valparaiso said the facades of some old buildings had fallen.
Public Works Minister Laurence Golbourne said that that Chile's airports and roadways appeared undamaged.
Chile is highly earthquake-prone. A magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Chile on March 25, the strongest and longest that many people said they had felt since a huge quake devastated that region two years ago. In 2010, the 8.8-magnitude quake caused a tsunami that obliterated much of the coastal downtown of the central Chilean city"

The United States said Monday it does not intend to relax the sanctions against Iran , despite the fact that the latest round of talks over Iranian nuclear works which were held in Istanbul have been considered a ""first positive step "". The United States renewed its call to Tehran, asking it to take concrete steps to address concerns surrounding its disputed nuclear program.
""As we have already said, we want to see Iran offering concrete proposals and move forward, and if realized, then we could consider gesture measures. Nevertheless, we consider the talks in Istanbul as a very first positive step, ""said the spokesman of U.S. State Department Mark Toner during a press conference.
Despite these positive beginnings, the spokesman denied that the U.S. has the intention of relaxing its sanctions against Iran . ""The sanctions remain in place for now. Nobody has mentioned cancellation of sanctions,"" he said.
The United States hopes that the talks in Istanbul will be the beginning of a ""sustainable process"", and it is already preparing for a second meeting to be held next month in Baghdad,  Iraq, said Toner.
Iran and the five members of the Security Council of the UN (United States, France, Russia, China, Great Britain) plus Germany, which form the P5 +1, completed a series of talks Saturday on Iran's nuclear program in Istanbul, Turkey. Both sides described the talks as positive and agreed to meet again in Baghdad on May 23.
Mr. Toner noted that the U.S. had made it clear that its ultimate goal was to see Iran ""take concrete steps to address unequivocally the concerns of the international community over its nuclear program.""
Referring to international sanctions against Iran, Mr. Toner said he believed that Iran had ""every reason to engage constructively in this dialogue, and come to the negotiating table with concrete proposals "".
Despite Tehran's insistence on the peaceful aspect of its nuclear program, European countries and the U.S. suspect Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons, and threatened to use force to prevent Tehran from becoming a nuclear power.
While acknowledging that the negotiating process would take some time, Mr. Toner has stressed the urgency of solving the Iranian nuclear crisis through peaceful negotiations."
article-11816.xml,"Thousands of Palestinians marked on Tuesday the Prisoner's Day in solidarity with 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, who went on an open-ended hunger strike in Israeli jails, until the Israeli prison services meet the demands of improving their living conditions.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed a written letter to mark the day, calling for implementing the Fourth Geneva Convention related to protecting civilians in times of war in the Palestinian territories, treating the Palestinian prisoners as prisoners of war and enabling them to gain their basic rights.
The cabinet of the caretaker Palestinian government in the West Bank, which held its weekly meeting in Ramallah, called on the United Nations for immediate and serious intervention and pressure on Israel to release all the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Hundreds of Palestinians rallied or joined demonstrations held in several West Bank and Gaza Strip cities. They marked the Palestinian Prisoner's Day, the day when the first Palestinian prisoner was freed in a first ever prisoners' swap deal reached between Palestinians militants and Israel in 1974.
Among the demonstrators, there was a group of children, who wore the uniform of the prisoners in Israeli jails while their hands and legs were tied by chains of iron. A former Jordanian prisoner who was released in a Hamas-Israel prisoners swap deal on Oct. 18 also attended the demonstration.
The crowd waved Palestinian flags as well as flags of various Palestinian Islamic and national factions, carried pictures of the old prisoners and chanted slogans against Israel's policy against the prisoners. Civil Palestinian servants also went on a strike for several hours.
Abdel Rahim Mallouh, a member of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), told a rally in Ramallah that the prisoners "" are the address of the first central issue the Palestinian people stand around,"" calling for the immediate reconciliation and ending the division.
Qadoura Fares of the Palestinian Prisoner's Club said that about 1,500 detainees started the strike Tuesday. He noted that the strikers represent all factions in all Israeli detention facilities and prisons. He added that more prisoners will join the strike if their demands were not met.
Meanwhile, the cities of Nablus, Hebron and Jenin in the West Bank had witnessed similar demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners. Speakers in the rallies agreed to keep supporting the prisoners' issue and said that Israel must respond to their demands of improving their living conditions and free them.
The rally in Hebron was distinctive with a significant participation of leaders from both Fatah Party and Islamic Hamas movement amid calls for keeping the unity of the prisoners' movement in Israeli jails, as not all the 4,700 prisoners went on the hunger strike.
The prisoners were all supposed to join the hunger strike, but deep disputes between the two rival groups had led to a division among the prisoners. Most of the prisoners were waiting for the results of the negotiations with the Israeli prisons' services.
The hunger striking prisoners are demanding the Israeli authorities to stop the administrative detention (a detention with no trial), end the policy of isolating prisoners in solitary sells, allowing prisoners families from Gaza to visit their sons in Israeli jails and improving their living conditions.
Clashes broke out near the Israeli jail of Ofer near Ramallah between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soldiers. The soldiers dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas and rubber bullets after they threw stones at the them. Several Palestinians were injured, according to medics.
Ahmed Bahar, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas-dominated parliament, called for a third popular uprising, or Intifada in the Palestinian territories and various Arab countries in support for the prisoners, adding ""armed resistance is the only method to free prisoners.""
Speakers of various factions, mainly rival Fatah and Hamas also spoke to demonstrators in Gaza, who called for a broader Arab and international move to protect the prisoners and release them from the Israeli jails."
article-12028.xml,"A mother was shot to death and her newborn son snatched from her outside a suburban Texas pediatric center, but the 3-day-old boy was found safe about six hours later.
Kala Marie Golden's mother said her daughter ""died trying to save her baby.""
Golden was leaving a checkup with her son, Keegan, at the Northwoods Pediatric Center in Spring, a suburb north of Houston. In the parking lot, she got into a verbal altercation with a woman in a Lexus parked next to her pickup truck, Montgomery County sheriff's Lt. Dan Norris said.
Witnesses said the woman repeatedly shot Golden, took the infant and sped away, hitting the dying mother as she screamed, ""My baby!"" and tried to reach into the Lexus, Norris said.
Witnesses also reported hearing as many as seven gunshots and said a man also wa in the sky blue or light green Lexus, which was blood-stained on the driver's side, Norris said.
The boy was found safe around 8 p.m. Tuesday, after his mother, District Attorney Brett Ligon said. Ligon said the child was ""healthy"" and that a person of interest had been detained, although no charges had bee filed. He would not provide any details about the person.
Golden's mother, Linda Golden, told the AP later Tuesday that she had been baby-sitting one of her daughter's other sons when she was alerted to the incident by someone at the scene who called her using her daughter's cellphone. She rushed to the clini but was unable to see her daughter because paramedics were trying to save her.
""I wanted to kiss her before they put her in the ambulance,"" Linda Golden said.
Ligon wouldn't say where the infant was found, but he said it wasn't at a nearby apartment complex where officers wielding guns and riot shieldssearched earlier Tuesday evening.
Investigators were processing evidence Tuesday night at one apartment in the complex that was searched, and they took away a vehicle that was parked in front. Photographs taken by news media at the scene show the vehicle was a light-colored Lexus.
Joshua Jesson said he wa in the clinic with his girlfriend when he heard gunshots. He said he saw a Lexus next to the pickup truck, then later looked back and saw the car was gone and a woman lying in the spot where the Lexus had been parked.
""I thought she just passed out. Then somebody ran in here and said, 'Somebody got shot,""' e said.
Police quickly surrounded the clinic and much of the parking lot with crime-scene tape, and yellow markers were placed next to a purse and pair of brown sandals near a red pickup truck. Spent ammunition also was nearby.
Authorities late Tuesday were doing background checks on family members with te hope of returning Keegan to them on Wednesday.
Linda Golden described her daughter as sweet-natured and kind.
She said she had no idea what could have sparked the slaying and abduction.

article-12070.xml,"U.S. Secret Service agents and military personnel took as many as 21 women back to their hotel in Colombia in an incident last week involving alleged misconduct with prostitutes, a Republican senator said yesterday.
“There are 11 agents involved. Twenty or 21 women foreign nationals were brought to the hotel, but allegedly Marines were involved with the rest,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine - who was briefed by the director of the Secret Service, Mark Sullivan - said in an email to Reuters.
“Director Sullivan is rightly appalled by the agents actions and is pursuing a vigorous internal investigation,” said Collins, the senior Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. “He ordered all the agents to return to Washington immediately, and all have been interviewed.”
More details about the incident that marred President Barack Obama’s weekend trip to the Summit of the Americas in Categena, Colombia emerged yesterday.
A Marine Corps spokesman said two Marine dog handlers assigned to support the Secret Service are being investigated to determine whether they were involved in soliciting prostitutes.
The spokesman, Captain Kevin Schultz, said the Marines were on the advance team and were not in direct contact with Obama.
The Secret Service has revoked the top security clearances of its 11 agents and placed them on administrative leave due to the incident.
The agents brought the prostitutes to their beachfront hotel in Cartagena, before Obama arrived for the summit, according to a local police source. A U.S. official told Reuters that more than 10 military service members also may have been involved.

article-12556.xml,"The United States has swiftly condemned photos of soldiers posing with the mangled corpses of insurgents in Afghanistan, seeking to limit the fallout from the latest scandal involving US troops.
The photographs, which date back to 2010 but were published by the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, add to a string of damaging incidents that have ignited anti-Western feeling and complicated NATO efforts to withdraw most troops in 2014.
US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said those responsible would be punished but voiced ""regret"" that the LA Times had decided to publish the images against the Pentagon's wishes, warning that they could prompt a violent backlash, reports AFP.
""I know that war is ugly and it's violent and I know that young people sometimes caught up in the moment make some very foolish decisions,"" Panetta told a NATO press conference in Brussels.
""I'm not excusing that behaviour, but neither do I want these images to bring further injury to our people and to our relationship with the Afghan people.""
The LA Times published two of 18 photographs it was given by a soldier who believed they pointed to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that compromised the safety of the troops.
One showed a soldier with a dead insurgent's hand draped on his right shoulder. The other showed soldiers grinning and giving a thumbs-up behind the disembodied legs of a Taliban fighter.
The Times said another set of photos, which it has not yet published, show soldiers from the same division holding a dead man's severed hand with the middle finger raised.
The first incident took place in February 2010, when paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division's 4th Brigade Combat Team were sent to an Afghan police station in Zabul province to inspect the remains of an alleged suicide bomber.
The soldiers had orders to try to get fingerprints and possibly scan the irises of the corpse, but instead they posed for pictures next to the Afghan police, holding up or squatting beside the remains, the LA Times reported.
A few months later, the same platoon went to inspect the remains of three insurgents whom Afghan police said had blown themselves up by accident.
The soldiers allegedly involved in the incident served in a unit plagued by leadership problems, according to media reports.
The commander of the brigade was cited for allowing a poor command climate, and a battalion leader and senior enlisted officer were relieved of their posts after showing racist and sexist slides in PowerPoint briefings, the Army Times reported.
The wife of the brigade commander also was reportedly banned from participating in family morale events at the unit's base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina after an investigation found she was harassing other spouses.
Senior US officials insisted the incident did not signal any wider discipline problem, and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the photos did not represent the values of the alliance's mission.
""These events took place apparently a couple of years ago and I consider them an isolated event,"" he said.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said the photos were ""reprehensible"" but also said President Barack Obama's administration was ""very disappointed"" that the paper had published them.
The newspaper's editor, Davan Maharaj, said he had decided to publish a ""small but representative selection"" of the images because of their news value and to ""fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the American mission in Afghanistan.""

In Baghdad, three car bombs, two roadside bombs and one suicide car bomb hit mainly Shi'ite areas, killing 15 people and wounding 61, the sources said.
Two car bombs and three roadside bombs aimed at police and army patrols in the northern oil city of Kirkuk killed eight people and wounded 26, police and hospital sources said.
""I was trying to stop traffic to let a police patrol pass ...A car bomb exploded, I fell on the ground and police took me to the hospital,"" a policeman wounded in the face and chest told Reuters as doctors tended him. He declined to be named.
It was Iraq's bloodiest day since Al Qaeda's affiliate in the country, the Islamic State of Iraq group, killed at least 52 people with a series of 30 blasts on March 20.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for Thursday's attacks.
Colonel Dhiya al-Wakeel, a spokesman for the Baghdad operations command, said the attacks were an attempt to convince the Iraqi people that the country was still insecure.
""Our forces are capable of confronting such challenges and this will not affect the improvement in the security situation or our security plans,"" Wakeel told the State-owned, Iraqiya TV.
Heightened tension between Shi'ites, Sunnis and Kurds in the coalition government since U.S. troops withdrew in December has raised fears of a return to sectarian violence of the kind that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war a few years ago.
The country is less violent than at the height of that conflict in 2006-07, but bombings and killings still happen daily, often aimed at Shi'ite areas and local security forces.
Kirkuk, home to Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen and others, is at the heart of a long-running dispute between the central government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which claims the city and the region's rich oil reserves.
Some critics say the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is not doing enough to stem the threat from militants.
""They are saying they are changing security plans, they are redeploying troops but it is like they are changing the decorations only,"" Ali Al-Haidari, an Iraqi security expert, told Reuters.
""Is there any new technology, any new laws supporting the security process? The answer is no. The natural result for that is there are gaps here and there.""
The biggest attack in Baghdad was in the Kadhimiya district, where a car bomb killed five and wounded 24, sources said.
A car bomb targeting the health minister's motorcade went off in the central Haifa district, killing two civilians and wounding at least four of the minister's guards, a police source said. His spokesman said five guards were wounded in the attack.
Car and roadside bombs also went off in Baghdad's Amil, Palestine Street and Zaafaraniya districts.
A political crisis erupted in Iraq in December when the Shi'ite-led government tried to remove Sunni Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq and sought an arrest warrant for Sunni Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi on charges he ran death squads.
Critics of Maliki viewed the moves as an attempt by the Shi'ite premier to consolidate power, and many Sunnis fear he is trying to sideline them from government. Maliki has said the charges against Hashemi were brought by the judicial system.
Parliament speaker Osama al-Nujaifi said security force leaders should take responsibility for not stopping the explosions. ""Some (groups) are seeking to exploit the domestic crisis to target unity and try to sow sectarian and racist strife,"" he said in a statement.
Elsewhere in northern Iraq, two car bombs targeting government-backed Sunni Sahwa militia went off in Samarra, two blasts hit Baquba, a roadside bomb exploded in Mosul and another roadside device exploded in Taji.
One policeman was killed in the town of Hadid, 10 km (6 miles) west of Baquba, when gunmen opened fire on the station where he worked from a passing car, police sources said.
In the mainly Sunni Muslim province of Anbar in the west, two car bombs targeting police killed four and wounded 10 in Ramadi while a roadside bomb wounded four people in Falluja."

Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported more Americans than expected filed for unemployment benefit in the week ended April 14, which also happens to coincide with the April payroll employment survey week, echoing the International Monetary Fund's view that job creation this year and next will be modest at best.
Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased by 2,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised figure of 388,000, to 386,000, according to data from the Labor Department issued Thursday in Washington. However, the level of claims was above market expectations for a 370,000 reading.
The four-week moving average, which normally provides a better indication of the underlying trend in labor markets, was 374,750, an increase of 5,500 from the previous week's upwardly revised average of 369,250 for first-time benefit applicants.
The number of people filing for benefits after an initial week of aid increased by 26,000, to 3.30 million in the week ended April 7. The continuing claims figure doesn't include the number of Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.
The four-week moving average for the week ended April 7 fell 21,500 to 3.32 million from the preceding week's revised average of 3.34 million.

		A Premier League superstar was mobbed by fans after he had a 6 inch haircut at an ordinary barbers in a terraced row of shops.
Newcastle United hitman Papiss Cisse has scored 10 goals in nine games since he signed from the German Bundesliga, and has fired the Geordies to the verge of European competition next season.
But the 7.5m man, believed to earn at least 40,000 a week, has not got too big for his boots since arriving in the North East.
Rather than use a sparkling salon, he visited The Barber Shop in Felling, Gateshead, which is run by Iyad Attallah, and parked his white Audi sports car, which has his named monogrammed on the wings, outside.
Rather than have the blinds closed and have a quiet cut in peace, the 26-year-old Senegal striker was happy for the shop to remain open.
By the time the trim was complete, about 50 young fans had got word of the star striker's presence and when he left they mobbed him for pictures and autographs, shouting ""We love you Cisse.""
The commotion was caught on mobile phones and fans posted the pictures on YouTube.
When manager Alan Pardew was asked about the reaction the player caused, he said: ""That sounds like the North East. I have never had it myself - only one or two turn up when I get my hair cut. Papiss has grown into a bit of a cult figure here in terms of what he has done and the way he has conducted himself.

article-13092.xml,"South Korea has asked China whether it is the source of a sophisticated missile carrier displayed by North Korea during a military parade last weekend, a Seoul official said Friday.
Military experts have pointed to China as the probable supplier of the 16-wheel truck, but China has denied it. U.N. Security Council resolutions ban countries from supplying arms-related materials to North Korea.
North Korea used the vehicle to unveil a new long-range missile during Sunday's celebrations marking the centennial of the birth of its late founder, Kim Il Sung. Two days earlier, North Korea launched a long-range rocket but said it failed to put a satellite in orbit.
Seoul was checking whether China, North Korea's only major ally, was the missile carrier provider, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue.
On Thursday, China denied any wrongdoing in connection with the vehicle's appearance at the North Korean parade. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told a regular news conference that China is against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and carriers for such weapons.
U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a briefing that China has repeatedly said it's complying fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions sanctioning North Korea. But Toner said he wasn't aware whether China had given assurances on the missile carrier.
The carrier, also believed capable of launching missiles, was the biggest yet displayed by North Korea and gives the country the ability to transport long-range missiles around its territory, making them harder to locate and destroy.

		Rhys Owen Jones, 21, and Keri Mules, 20, appeared before magistrates in 
Brisbane today and pleaded guilty to trespassing, stealing and keeping a 
protected animal, Australia’s Department of Justice said.
The two friends from south Wales were arrested after breaking into Sea World 
on Queensland’s Gold Coast during an alcohol-fuelled escapade on April 14.
They also swam with dolphins and let off a fire extinguisher in a shark 
enclosure, according to AAP news agency.
Jones, reported to be a former British Royal Marine and Mules, reported to be 
a bricklayer, were in Australia on a working holiday visa when the incident 
took place.
They snuck into the animal park along with Australian James Vasilj, 18, after 
drinking 1.5 litres of vodka between them at a beach party, AAP said.
The two Welshmen then snatched a fairy penguin called Dirk from an aquarium 
before waking up with the flightless bird in their apartment the following 
day.
The friends’ lawyer Bill Potts told Southport Magistrates’ court they meant no 
harm to the animal and tried to care for it by feeding it and putting it in 
the shower when they woke up with hangovers.
Jones and Mules took photo and video footage of the animal before releasing it 
into a canal, but were arrested after a friend saw updates they had posted 
about their antics on Facebook and reported them to police.
The seven-year-old bird was later spotted by a member of the public, rescued 
unharmed and returned to Sea World before it was reunited with girlfriend 
Peaches.
Mr Potts told magistrate Brian Kucks that the tourists’ actions were immature 
and stupid, but there was no malice involved, according to reports.
The court also heard how the Britons had written a letter of apology to Sea 
World and the Australian public and deeply regretted their actions.
Mr Kucks accepted an appeal not to record convictions against the pair and 
fined them 1000 Australian dollars each.
AAP quoted him saying: “You could have found yourselves in a morgue if you’d 
gone into the wrong enclosure. Perhaps next time you are at a party you will 
consider drinking a little less vodka.""
Following the hearing Mr Potts told reporters: “The boys understand they did 
something stupid. They are just pleased that in the end no penguin was 
harmed.""
Vasilj, who is facing a single charge of trespassing, had his case adjourned 
to June 27.

Many protesters are supporters of an ultraconservative Islamist candidate in elections, whose candidature was expelled from the election race when it was discovered that his mother held dual Egyptian-U.S. citizenship.  Police said that the attack on Wednesday wounded at least 50 protesters, and that the attackers ""used stones, sticks and Molotov cocktails"".

		Fabrice Muamba will attend the Barclays Premier League match between Bolton and Tottenham at the Reebok Stadium.
It will mark the first time the Wanderers midfielder has attended a game since he suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup tie between Bolton and Spurs at White Hart Lane on March 17.
Bolton manager Owen Coyle said: ""We are absolutely delighted that we will be able to welcome Fabrice and his family back to the Reebok, and we are all looking forward to seeing him.""
He added: ""It's fitting that the match is between these two clubs and that Fabrice is able to come along.
""I know Fabrice is very keen to show his appreciation to both sets of fans for their support.""
The 24-year-old, whose heart stopped beating for 78 minutes following his collapse, spent a month at the London Chest Hospital before being discharged on April 16.
The speed of Muamba's recovery amazed medical professionals.
He started talking two days after his collapse and began walking just over a fortnight later, although it is not yet known if he will play professional football again.
Since his discharge the midfielder has continued his rehabilitation at home and on Saturday the former England Under-21 midfielder took to his Twitter account for the first time since the incident.
In his message he thanked people for their ""prayers, love and support'' and wished his team-mates well ahead of their match at Sunderland, which they drew 2-2."
article-13494.xml,"Pre-election violence has erupted in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, killing at least 11 people, wounding more than 100 others, and prompting several presidential candidates to suspend their campaigns. Egyptian medical and security sources confirmed the death toll in Wednesday's fighting, which began at dawn when assailants raided a protest camp occupied by hundreds of activists opposed to the military-backed government. Protesters' demands The mostly Islamist protesters had been camping near the Egyptian defense ministry in Cairo's Abbassiya district since Saturday, demanding an immediate end to military rule in Egypt. The protesters fought back against the assailants, described by some witnesses as pro-government ""thugs."" The rival groups attacked each other with firebombs and stones. Gunfire also was heard at the scene.  
Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood announced a two-day suspension in solidarity with the victims. The Brotherhood also declared a boycott of a meeting with Egypt's ruling military council planned for later on Wednesday. The other leading Islamist candidate, Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, cancelled his next campaign events in protest at how authorities handled the Cairo street battles. Egypt's presidential election will be the first since a popular uprising ousted longtime autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. The military council that took over from Mubarak has promised a democratic transition and a transfer of power to an elected president by July 1. But, Egypt's generals have faced strong domestic criticism for their handling of that process, which has been plagued by periodic eruptions of deadly violence, often surrounding anti-government protests in major cities. Many of the protesters camped outside the Egyptian defense ministry are Islamists who were angered by the ruling military's decision to bar ultraconservative Islamist cleric Hazem Abu Ismail from standing in the presidential contest. Egypt's election commission disqualified Abu Ismail because his mother had taken joint U.S. citizenship. Some liberal pro-democracy activists had joined the Islamists at the encampment in calling for Egypt's ruling generals to step down immediately.

		Standard abd Poor's has raised Greece's credit rating.
It is now no longer in default territory, but remains firmly in the junk category with a CCC rating.
The upgrade was expected after Athens slashed its debt by about a third with a massive sovereign debt restructuring.
But SandP is still warning that a deep recession, unpredictable elections and anti-austerity anger threaten Greece's efforts to put its finances back on track.
""While the exchange has, in our view, alleviated near-term funding pressures, Greece's sovereign debt burden remains high,"" S&;P said in a statement, adding that it expected the debt to stay as high as 160-170 percent of GDP in the next three years.
S&;P assigned Greece's rating a stable outlook, indicating it was not planning to change the rating again soon, but it warned that risks remained.
""The ratings could be lowered if we believe that there is a likelihood of a distressed exchange on Greece's remaining stock of commercial debt,"" it said.
Fitch assigned Greece a slightly higher B-rating in mid-March, becoming the first major rating agency to upgrade Athens' rating after the swap cut its debt by about 100 billion euros.

article-13886.xml,"Gunfire rang out in Mali's capital Bamako on Wednesday in the third day of clashes between the military junta and soldiers loyal to the ousted president, forcing residents to flee.
A Malian security source told Reuters the junta's troops were asking people to leave their buildings as they searched for loyalist fighters, including suspected foreign mercenaries, who had mounted a counter-coup attempt.
""We're looking for red berets,"" yelled one junta soldier, before firing his rifle into the air.
Shooting was also heard from the direction of the state broadcaster building, scene of some of the heaviest fighting since Monday but which has remained under the junta's control.
""The evacuation is meant to help the work of the soldiers who are in the process of sweeping the city in search of mercenaries that have infiltrated the population,"" the security source said, asking not to be named.
A Reuters witness said firing also broke out in downtown Bamako, where administrative buildings were being evacuated and residents were fleeing on foot and by car.
Members of the red beret presidential guard unit attacked important sites in and around Bamako late on Monday in an apparent attempt to unseat the military junta that has been in power since a coup on March 22.
Residents said heavy and automatic weapons fire was heard coming from the red berets training camp in the Sebenicoro neighbourhood, west of Bamako, after a column of junta tanks and armored cars moved to seize the camp.
""We hear gunfire everywhere, I have just heard heavy weapons. They carrying out a mopping-up operation in the last pocket of the red berets resistance,"" said a resident of the neighbourhood."

article-14409.xml,"Syrian security forces stormed student dorms at a northwestern university to break up anti-government protests there, killing at least four students and wounding several others with tear gas and live ammunition, activists and opposition groups said Thursday.
Around 1,500 students had been protesting in student quarters next to Aleppo University's main campus late Wednesday when security forces and pro-regime gunmen swept into their residences, firing tear gas at first, then live ammunition to disperse them.
Student activist Thaer al-Ahmed said panic and chaos ensued as students tried to flee.
""Some students ran to their rooms to take cover but they were followed to their rooms, beaten up and arrested,"" he said. ""Others suffered cuts and broken bones as they tried to flee.""
Raids and intermittent gunfire continued for about five hours through early Thursday, he said, adding that dozens of people were wounded, some critically, and around 50 students were arrested.
Aleppo, Syria's largest city and economic hub, has a population that has remained largely loyal to President Bashar Assad and has been largely spared from the violence that has plagued other Syrian cities.
But university students have been staging almost daily protests calling for the fall of Assad's regime. Al-Thaer, a law student, said the campus and dormitories have been raided before, but Thursday's raid was the most violent.
The student quarters — known as the University City — comprise 20 dormitories next to the university campus. Students there often shouted out anti-Assad slogans from their rooms at night, al-Thaer said.
An amateur video showed a large number of security forces apparently storming the dorms Wednesday night. Another showed a students protest earlier Wednesday, during which protesters shouted: ""We don't want you, Bashar!""
The authenticity of the videos could not be confirmed.
The Local Coordination Committees activist group said five students were killed and some 200 arrested in the raids, while the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at four. The Syrian government has prevented independent reporting in the country, making it impossible to independently verify casualty figures.
""Regime forces demanded through loudspeakers that the dorms be evacuated, then began detaining the students,"" the LCC said in a statement.
Syria's persistent bloodshed has tarnished efforts by a U.N. team of observers to salvage a truce brokered by U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan that started to unravel almost as soon as it was supposed to begin on April 12.
The two sides have blamed each other for thwarting the truce, with Assad's forces trying to repress demonstrators calling for him to step down and an armed rebellion that has sprung up as peaceful protests have proved ineffective against his forces. The U.N. says 9,000 people have died since the uprising began in March 2011.
Despite the violence, the international community still sees the peace plan as the last chance to prevent Syria from falling into civil war — in part because no country wants to intervene militarily.
The head of the U.N. observers, Norwegian Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, visited the central cities of Homs and Hama, where anti-regime sentiment runs high, on Thursday.

		A student who was left handcuffed and forgotten in a tiny holding cell for four days is suing US authorities for $20m (€15m).
After two days and desperate for food and water, Daniel Chong said he realised he had to stop wondering when he would be let out and start thinking about how to stay alive.
Entering what he called “survival mode,” and already drinking his own urine, he tried to trigger an overhead fire sprinkler for some water, stacking clothes and a blanket and swinging his cuffed arms in an attempt to set it off.
Chong, 23, a student at the University of California, San Diego, had been picked up in a drug sweep but was never arrested or charged.
He spent four days forgotten in the windowless cell before Drug Enforcement Administration agents opened the door.
After his release, he spent five days in hospital for dehydration, kidney failure, cramps and a perforated oesophagus. He had lost 15lbs.
His lawyers have filed the $20m claim against the Drug Enforcement Administration, saying his treatment constitutes torture under US and international law.
The top DEA agent in San Diego, William R Sherman, said he was “deeply troubled” by what happened to Chong.
Sherman said he has personally ordered an extensive review of his office’s policies and procedures. The agency declined to say what those were.
Chong said no one has contacted him personally to apologise.
He was among nine people taken into custody when agents stormed the house he was staying in and netted 18,000 ecstasy pills, other drugs and weapons.
Chong was questioned then agents told him he was not a suspect and would be released shortly. He signed some paperwork, was put in handcuffs and sent back to the holding cell.
As the hours dragged into days, he said he kicked and screamed as loud as he could. At one point, he ripped a piece of his jacket off with his teeth and shoved it under the door, hoping someone would spot it and free him.
Chong said he ingested a white powder that he found in the cell. Agents later identified it as methamphetamine. Chong said he ingested it to survive.
The next day, hallucinations started, he said. They included Japanese animation characters who told him to dig into the walls to search for water, which he tried, tearing apart the wall’s plastic lining.
People can die from dehydration in as little as three to seven days, said Dr Wally Ghurabi at UCLA Medical Centre in Santa Monica.
Ghurabi said Chong was wise to drink his own urine to stay hydrated.
As the days dragged on, Chong said he accepted that he would die. He considered taking his own life rather than withering away by dehydration.
He sat in the dark, his hallucinations deepening, his breath getting shorter and shorter, even the urine running out, and he screamed for the agents to at least let him have a quick death.

article-14969.xml,"The Olympic torch has begun its journey to London after surviving a scare when the sacred flame was extinguished shortly before it was used to light the 'cheese grater', The Telegraph reports.
A gust of wind put the flame out as it was being carried out in a bowl from the temple of Hera, where it had been lit from the rays of the sun, into the ancient stadium in Olympia.
The Priestess carrying the flame had to leave the arena and re-light the bowl from a lamp that had been lit earlier as insurance against the flame going out.
The London torch was then successfully lit and the first leg of the relay was run through the ancient Olympic stadium by Liverpool-born Greek swimming world champion Spyros Gianniotis.
He handed the torch to Alex Loukos from Newham, 19, who was a member of the victorious London bid team in Singapore in 2005.

The story that a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor — but only the mother was rescued — made headlines Thursday across Britain and Ireland.
But police said officers have concluded the woman fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.
Police say other passengers on the ferry from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing her family, they now believe she had no child with her.

Fourteen people - 12 passengers and two crew - were on board the aircraft when it came down 40km off the coast of Aberdeen shortly after noon.
The EC225 helicopter, operated by Bond Offshore, had been on its way from Aberdeen to the offshore Maersk Resilient rig and the Ensco 102 rig.
Rig operator Conoco Phillips said the passengers were contractors on their way to support the drilling rigs.
Two of those on board worked for Halliburton and the others were from Ensco, Brundt and Stag, Conoco Phillips said. The companies could not be immediately contacted for comment.
A Bond spokesman said: ""A low pressure oil warning light came on and the helicopter made a controlled descent and landed in the North Sea. It didn't crash.""
The alarm was raised and a major rescue began. Everyone on board was recovered from the sea and put in life rafts. They were then being flown back to Aberdeen for medical checks, although it is understood nobody was injured.
The coastguard said three search and rescue helicopters, including one from the coastguard and one from the RAF, were at the scene, along with two lifeboats.
The ditching was the latest in a series of incidents involving helicopters in the North Sea.

She is being held and questioned under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.
It is the eighth arrest over the killing of the 29-year-old father of one, whose body was found on farmland in Co Meath earlier this month. No one has yet been charged.

article-15391.xml,"Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed when the Real IRA bomb ripped through the Co Tyrone market town on 15 August, 1998.
The family campaigners have previously demanded a cross-border inquiry into whether the authorities in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland could have done more to prevent the bombing.
Relatives who commissioned the report met Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson in Belfast on Thursday ahead of presenting the final version to the UK Government next month.
Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden was murdered in the attack, said the meeting was ""hot and heavy"".
""We told him we have evidence that there was a live police operation going on on August 15 that could have intercepted the bombers,"" he said.
""This is new evidence that hasn't been made public before.""
He added: ""We also have evidence that public officials lied to the general public about the Omagh bombing.
""We will be producing all of that evidence to him on June 18.""
Mr Gallagher said he would not be outlining full details of the evidence unearthed until the report had been passed to the Westminster Government.
The Omagh Support and Self Help Group commissioned the report from a group of London-based consultants who have interviewed key figures associated with the case.
The consultants have also examined material already compiled on the bombing.
The documentation includes police reports from both sides of the Irish border, a probe carried out by the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland, plus a government-sponsored review of how intelligence on the attack was handled.
The relatives also secured disclosure of other documents linked to the case.

Adam Mayes, 35, died Thursday evening after authorities acted on a tip and found him in the area near New Albany, Miss. When they went to arrest him, he shot himself in the head, said Guntown Police Chief Michael Hall.
The girls, Alexandra Bain, 12, and Kyliyah Bain, 8, were being taken to a hospital for observation, Hall said. It was not immediately clear if they were with Mayes when he was killed.
Mayes had been charged with first-degree murder in the April 27 deaths of Jo Ann Bain, 31, and her daughter, Adrienne, 14. Their bodies were found buried outside the Mayes' home a week after they were reported missing by Jo Ann Bain's husband.
Mayes' wife, Teresa, also is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths. She told investigators he killed Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain at their Whiteville, Tenn., home so he could abduct the two young sisters, according to court documents.
Teresa Mayes told investigators that after she saw her husband kill the two in the garage at the Bain home, she drove him, the younger girls and the bodies to Mississippi, according to affidavits filed in court. She faces six felony counts in the case: two first-degree murder charges and four especially aggravated kidnapping charges.
Authorities refused to comment on the motive for the April 27 slayings and abductions.
Mayes' mother-in-law, Josie Tate, told the Associated Press that Mayes thought the missing sisters might actually be his daughters and it caused problems in his marriage to her daughter, Teresa, who is jailed in the case.

It was not immediately clear what specific information the FTC was looking for, the source said. The Commission automatically initiates a review of any acquisition of significant size.
The acquisition of the top photo-sharing service on the Internet is a crucial part of Facebook's strategy to bolster its mobile offerings, at a time when consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet through smarpthones.
Facebook had said it hopes to complete the deal -- the largest in Facebook's history -- in the second quarter, but some observers think that may be an ambitious target, given the size of the deal and Facebook's status as the world's No.1 Internet social network with roughly 900 million users.
The FTC's review of the deal comes as Facebook is preparing to raise as much as $12 billion in a record-breaking initial public offering that could occur as soon as next week.
Some investors have cited Facebook's limited advertising revenue from the mobile versions of its service as a potential concern with regards to the company's long-term growth potential.

article-15708.xml,"Andre Iguodala hopped on the scorer's table and played to the crowd as the catchy 76ers' anthem blared in the arena.
His teammates joined Iguodala and danced along as confetti fluttered around them.
""Number one, Philadelphia. Here they come, team of the year.""
Team of the first round, for sure.
Eight years of going home empty in April is over. The Sixers at last had a reason to go wild.
Iguodala made the go-ahead free throws with 2.2 seconds left and Philadelphia rallied for a 79-78 victory over the top-seeded Chicago Bulls in Game 6 on Thursday night, advancing to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time since 2003.
The 76ers will face Boston, which beat Atlanta in six games, in the conference semifinals.
""I don't know how we won this game,"" coach Doug Collins said.
Collins and the Sixers hardly cared the series win comes with an asterisk.
The Bulls lost reigning MVP Derrick Rose to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee late in their Game 1 win. Center Joakim Noah missed the last three games with a sprained left ankle.
""I thought we had more than enough to win with,"" Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""I'm disappointed in the loss but I'm not disappointed in our team.""
Without their stars, the Bulls found it tough to gut one out against the Sixers.
Omer Asik missed two free throws for the Bulls with 7 seconds left that would have given them a three-point lead. Iguodala grabbed the second miss, sprinted the length of the court, and was fouled by Asik on the driving layup.
The Sixers put their season in the hands of one of the worst fourth-quarter free-throw shooters in the NBA.
Collins was hunched over and his hands clasped with Iguodala at the line.
He made both — and 20,362 fans went absolutely wild.
Iguodala made nine of 10 free throws in the fourth quarter in this series after shooting 45 percent (23 of 51) from the line in the period this season.
Iguodala changed his approach at the line this series. He started thinking what it would be like to teach his son how to shoot free throws.
Dads don't miss.
""I was like, 'Son, this is how you shoot free throws,'"" Iguodala said.
The Sixers are the fifth No. 8 seed to win a first-round series against a No. 1 seed. Memphis eliminated San Antonio last season, while Golden State (2007), New York (1999) and Denver (1994) also pulled off the rare feat.
In his second season, Collins had already led the Sixers to their first winning season in seven years. Now, it's on to the second round for the first time since Allen Iverson was an All-Star.
The Sixers were smiling and mobbed each other as they dashed to the locker room to keep the party going.
The Sixers were 2.2 seconds from playing Game 7 in Chicago.
Now, they will pack their bags for the second round. They went 2-1 against the Celtics this season.
Collins had a catch in his voice at the postgame podium and was joined by his 4-year-old grandson, Cooper. Collins rubbed his head and held back tears talking about faith, family and his guys in the locker room.
""I'm a Sixer for life,"" he said.
Iguodala scored 20 points, and Jrue Holiday and Lou Williams each scored 14 for the Sixers who were outrebounded 56-33.
Iguodala snagged the one that mattered.
""We win on a rebound. Something we don't get all night,"" a smiling Collins said.
The Sixers started 20-9 and led the Atlantic Division for the first half of the season until a late fade sent them tumbling toward eighth place.
None of that matters now.
Not even the fact the Bulls were down two stars.
The 50-win Bulls are heading home early a year after they reached the conference finals.
""We were on the ropes and we battled,"" forward Carlos Boozer said. ""In the end, it came down to the very last second. So, it's tough. We were right there, given everything, right there. It will be a long summer.""
Luol Deng had 19 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulls. Richard Hamilton scored 19 points and Boozer grabbed 13 rebounds.
The Bulls had the lock-down defensive effort to nearly pull off the win.
The signature series came in the fourth quarter when the Sixers wasted a forced turnover on the other end with a brutal offensive possession.
Spencer Hawes missed a shot, Thaddeus Young missed two straight in the paint, and Hawes missed again against hands-up defense that sent the bench into a frenzy. Noah was the first one up pumping his fist and screaming encouragement for the fantastic defensive effort.
Hawes fired an airball next time down and there was a collective groan from the crowd.
Iguodala made up for a string of Sixers misses with a tying 3 that made it 70-all.
The Sixers tried to get a laugh by showing the Bulls bench on ""Kiss Cam."" Noah popped his warmup jacket toward the camera and the crowd booed the oversized ""Chicago"" on the big screen.
Noah was one of the top offensive rebounders in the league and the Bulls figured on missing his presence in the middle. Led by Deng and Boozer, the Bulls instead went out and controlled the boards, holding a 49-29 edge early in the fourth.
""We have to use this as motivation to move forward,"" Thibodeau said.
Notes: The Sixers scored a measly 26 first-half points in their Game 5 loss. They led Game 6 48-40 at halftime. The Sixers started 12 of 20 from the field and finished the half at 50 percent. They shot a season-low 32 percent in Game 5 and failed to shoot better than 40 percent in three other games.

""Those ten foreigners were eight from Russia, one from the United States and another one from France,"" DVI Executive Director Anton Castilani said here.
He said that five people among the 50 listed in the initial passengers manifest had reported to DVI about their safety. They cancelled to board the plane in last minutes before the plane took off from Halim Perdanakusumah airport for a demonstration flight.
""It means that there were 45 people onboard the plane. Identification of 35 Indonesian nationals had been reported by their families to DVI. Families of the French and the U.S. nationals onboard the plane have also reported identification of their relatives,"" Anton said.
He added that the data recorded by the agency fit to the manifest data recorded from the ill-fated Sukhoi plane.
Debris of the crashed plane were mostly found scattered in Cipelang hamlet, Cijeruk subdictrict in Bogor regency in West Java province.
The plane hit the wall of Mount Salak located in Bogor regency on Wednesday afternoon after its pilot contacted the Air Traffic Control (ATC) officials in Halim Perdanakusumah airport, asking permission to descent to 6,000 feet from a height of 10,000 feet.
The Indonesian rescuer team and the army engage helicopters to evacuate the remains of the killed passengers from the crash site in several sorties. Indonesian and Russian teams have prepared a joint team to identify the remains of those perished in the plane crash.
The fatal crash was the first in the world to involve Russia's iconic Sukhoi Superjet 100 passenger plane.
Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has issued an instruction to undertake a thorough investigation into the crash."

		Local television showed what appeared to be the plane's tail with the Sukhoi Superjet-100's blue and white logo, part of a wing and bits of twisted metal scattered along Mount Salak's slopes.
Thick fog kept helicopters away from the crash site, officials said, delaying potential answers to what caused the crash. Russian and French investigators arrived to join the probe as the difficulties of reaching bodies or the plane's black box became clear.
""Our six helicopters have been trying to get close to the crash site since this morning,"" said Sunarbowo Sandi, operational chief at Indonesia's search and rescue agency. ""With poor visibility of less than five metres, it's difficult for us to evacuate the victims.""
Mr Sandi said he hoped a ground team of 85 rescue workers using ropes to climb the mountain might reach the wreckage. The jet slammed into the volcano on Wednesday at nearly 480mph, raining debris down the slope.
He said communications with the ground team were difficult and it was still unclear what the climbers would find, given the possibility that much of the wreckage and possibly bodies had tumbled down the near-vertical slope.
Local television station TVOne reported that some rescuers have arrived on the scene and discovered some remnants of the plane but had so far found no survivors. All 45 aboard are feared dead.
The Sukhoi Superjet-100 is Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago and was supposed to kick-start the nation's efforts to modernise its fleet and resurrect its neglected aerospace industry.
The ill-fated Superjet was carrying representatives from local airlines and journalists on what was supposed to be a 50-minute demonstration flight. Just 21 minutes after take-off from a Jakarta airfield, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 10,000ft to 6,000ft. They gave no explanation, disappearing from the radar immediately afterwards. It was not clear why the crew asked to shift course, especially since they were so close to the 7,000ft volcano, or whether they got approval, officials have said.
Communication tapes will be reviewed as part of the investigation, but it is unlikely they will be released to the public soon."

Spain's economy, which sunk into a recession in the first three months of 2012, is not expected to grow again until the end of the year at the earliest.
Net profit at the euro zone's largest telecoms company, which operates as o2 in Ireland, fell 54 per cent to E748 million, below the bottom end of analyst forecasts that ranged from E764 million to E1.2 billion.
The bottom line was hit after Telefonica wrote down the value of its 10 per cent indirect stake in Telecom Italia to E337 million. Telefonica invested E2.3 billion when it bought the stake in 2008.
Italy's biggest telecom player posted a net loss for 2011 after a goodwill writedown on its domestic business due to an economic downturn.
Last week Telecom Italia shareholders agreed to refinance its investment vehicle's debt, meaning Telefonica must contribute E277 million to a capital increase and new bond issue.
Telefonica's revenue was virtually flat at E15.5 billion as fast growth in Latin America, which accounts for almost half of group revenue, compensated for tough competition in the company's main European markets, where revenues slipped.

Fighting often ebbs somewhat during the winter months in Afghanistan, with fighting usually intensifying after the snows melt. Over the past few months, the country was subjected to one of its harshest winters in 30 years.
Civilian casualties have generally been on the increase year-on-year in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion in 2001. Last year more than 3,000 civilians were killed and another 4,500 injured in Afghanistan, roughly a 5-percent increase compared to 2010.

article-16049.xml,"THE trial of Anders Behring Breivik was interrupted briefly by a family member of a victim who hurled a shoe at the confessed mass killer and yelled ""go to hell"" before being escorted from the court room.
The shoe attack, which came as a coroner presented more autopsy reports on the mostly-young victims of the July massacre at Utoya island was followed by applause, ""bravos"" and tears among onlookers in the courtroom, and led to a temporary suspension of proceedings on the 17th day of the trial.
The black shoe did not hit Breivik but landed on one of his lawyers, Vibeke Hein Baera, who sits between the accused and the onlookers.
""Luckily, it was just a shoe,"" Hein Baera said.
The attacker, a man of Iraqi origin whose brother was one of the 69 people Breivik shot dead on Utoya on July 22, was quickly brought under control by security guards and escorted out of the courtroom as he continued to shout in English: ""Go to Hell!""
When the proceedings resumed a few minutes later, Breivik addressed the onlookers.
""If someone wants to throw something at me, do it at me while I'm entering or leaving, and not at my lawyer,"" he said.
The shoe attack was the first serious incident since the beginning of the 33-year-old right-wing extremist's trial on April 16.
Breivik has been charged with committing terrorist acts on July 22 when he killed a total of 77 people by first bombing a government building in Oslo before going on a shooting rampage on Utoeya, where the ruling Labour Party's youth wing was hosting a summer camp.
He has confessed to the acts but has refused to plead guilty, insisting his massacres were ""cruel but necessary"" to stop the Labour Party's ""multicultural experiment"" and the ""Muslim invasion"" of Norway and Europe.
His mainly young victims were ""legitimate targets,"" he said.
The proceedings have so far been marked by tears and embraces among the survivors and victims' family members gathered in the courtroom, but until Friday none of the onlookers had directly addressed the confessed killer.
While he will surely be found guilty, his 10-week trial will help determine the tricky question of his sanity and whether he will be sent to prison or to a mental institution.
Two court-ordered evaluations have reached opposition conclusions, and it will be up to the five-judge panel to rule on the issue when they hand down their verdict in mid-July.
Breivik himself is intent upon proving his sanity so his anti-Islam ideology will not be written off as the ravings of a lunatic."

Pirates have hijacked a Greek-owned oil tanker carrying 135,000 tonnes of crude oil in the Arabian Sea, the first successful attack on an oil tanker off the Horn of Africa in more than a year.
The vessel's manager, Dynacom Tankers Management, said it had lost contact with the crew of the MT Smyrni, a Suezmax-class tanker, following the attack off Oman at 11.15 GMT on Thursday.
""The Liberian-flagged tanker, the MT Smyrni, is carrying a cargo of 135,000 tonnes of crude oil,"" it said.
Suezmax tankers typically can transport a crude oil cargo of up to 1m barrels, compared with 2m to 3m barrels for larger oil tankers.
Dynacom gave no further details but Kenya-based piracy expert Andrew Mwangura said the vessel was heading for the Somali coastline. Industry websites said the tanker had sailed from Turkey, but there were mixed reports about its destination.
""Aboard are nine Indians and about eight Filipinos,"" Mwangura, who is maritime editor of Somalia Report, said, adding: ""It is headed to Somalia.""
OceanUSlive.Org, a social networking site for the maritime industry, said the attack was one of four to have taken place in the Arabian Sea in the past few days after a lull in pirate activity.
The hijack success rate for Somali pirates has dropped sharply in recent months, due in part to more merchant ships using armed security guards, razor wire and water cannon to protect themselves.
In its statement, Dynacom did not disclose whether the Smyrni was carrying private security personnel.
On Wednesday, a gang of pirates fired rocket-propelled grenades at a crude tanker 350 miles (565 km) east of Socotra, an island between Yemen and Somalia, according to OceanUSlive.org.
Seaborne gangs have raked in an estimated $150m (£93m) in ransoms in what has become a highly organised, international criminal enterprise, say security analysts
Somali pirates in December released an Italian-owned Aframax oil tanker – smaller than the Suezmax – after receiving an $11.5m (£7.1m) payment. The Savina Caylyn was seized in February 2011.
Despite successful efforts to quell attacks in the Gulf of Aden, international navies have struggled to contain piracy in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea owing to the vast distances involved.

article-16068.xml,"The Vatican is investigating seven priests from the troubled Legion of Christ religious order for alleged sexual abuse of minors, according to the Associated Press news agency.
All but one case involves alleged abuse dating from decades ago, the Legion said.
Two other priests are also under investigation for alleged sacramental violations, believed to involve using spiritual direction to have inappropriate relations with women.
It is the first time the Vatican is known to have taken action against Legion priests for alleged sexual assault following the scandal of the order's founder.
The church had previously insisted the crimes of the late Reverend Marcial Maciel were his alone.
He was long held up as a model by Pope John Paul II despite credible accusations - later proven - that he raped and molested his seminarians.
The Legion of Christ order had over 900 priests worldwide and was praised for attracting both money and vocations to the priesthood.
Documentation from Vatican archives, however, revealed that as early as the 1950s, the Vatican had evidence that Maciel was a drug addict and paedophile.
Only in 2006 did the Vatican sanction Maciel to a lifetime of penance and prayer for his crimes.
He died in 2008 and a year later the orthodox order confessed he had fathered three children with two different women and had abused his seminarians.
In 2010 the Vatican took control of the Legion and started to implement a system of change.

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, JPMorgan reported that since the end of March, its chief investment office has had significant mark-to-market losses in its synthetic credit portfolio.
While other gains partially offset the trading loss, the bank estimates the business unit will post a loss of $800 million in the current quarter, excluding private equity results and litigation expenses. The bank previously forecast the unit would make a profit of about $200 million.
“It could cost us as much as $1 billion or more,” in addition to the loss estimated so far, Dimon said. 
The dollar loss, though, could be less significant than the hit to Dimon and the reputation of a bank which was strong enough to take over investment bank Bear Stearns and consumer bank Washington Mutual when they collapsed in 2008.
JPMorgan had $2.32 trillion of assets supported by $190 billion of shareholder equity at the end of March — an equity ratio of almost 13%. That is four times the industry mean and ahead of 10-11% at Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. JPMorgan has been earning more than $4 billion each quarter, on average, for the past two years.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted witnesses as saying the bodies had been found dumped in a square in the restive city on Monday.
The claim has not been independently verified, as most foreign media are banned from entering Syria.
Meanwhile, Damascus says it responded ""positively"" to an Arab League plan aimed at ending months of unrest.
Foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al-Makdisi told reporters a letter by President Bashar al-Assad's government had been sent to the Cairo-based Arab League, adding that he expected a deal to be signed soon.
He spoke after the expiry of the organisation's latest deadline for Damascus to agree to its peace plan and allow in observers to monitor it or face the imposition of further sanctions approved last week.
The Arab League secretary general, Nabil al-Arabi, confirmed receipt of the letter, but noted that it contained new elements which were now being studied by Arab foreign ministers.
Syria is under pressure to end its crackdown on an uprising the UN says has left more than 4,000 people dead since the unrest began in March. Later on Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights quoted witnesses as saying that the bodies of at least 34 civilians had been seen by an activist in the pro-government district of al-Zahra.
It said the victims had been seized on Monday by armed regime supporters, known locally as ""shabiha"", from districts opposed to the government.
Government forces have laid siege to Homs for the past two months.
The Observatory also reported that shabiha had abducted a bus driver and his 13 passengers in Homs province on Monday.
The Local Co-ordination Committee, an activist group that documents and organises protests, also said at least 17 people had been killed on Monday, including 14 in Homs.
Last week, UN Human Rights Council strongly condemned the ""gross and systematic"" violations by Syrian forces, and said it was appointing a special investigator to report on the ongoing crackdown.
The Syrian government says it is fighting armed terrorist gangs.

Tsipras insists he won’t join any coalition government seeking to push ahead with an international bailout deal. The continued political deadlock is bringing the prospect of an election re-run ever closer.
The discussions continue... but without agreement, and apparently, with little compromise.
Leftists leader Alexis Tsipras on Sunday met with President Karolos Papoulias, along with the leaders of Greece’s two other main parties - the conservative ""New Democracy"" and the socialist ""PASOK"".
THEY’RE both accusing Tsipras’s SYRIZA party of shirking its social responsibility, by refusing to participate in a unity government.
But speaking afterwards, Tsipras reiterated that his party was bound by its election promise - to DITCH the country’s EU-IMF-backed bailout agreement.
Tsipras said, ""We take our responsibilities seriously. And the biggest responsibility we have is to not let the people, or our supporters, lose hope. We must not backtrack on what we promised before the election. And we won’t. ""
There remains the small possibility of a coalition that excludes SYRIZA. The smaller Democratic Left party could provide enough seats to form a majority government with New Democracy and PASOK. But they’ve so far refused to consider such a deal - unless the coalition also includes SYRIZA.
The president’s mediation process could potentially run until May 17th, the scheduled opening date for the new parliament.
If no agreement is reached, Greece will have to hold new elections next month, most likely on June 10th or 17th.

Rahmani was one of about 70 influential Afghans and former Taliban members appointed to the High Peace Council. Its aim is to convince insurgent leaders to reconcile with the government.
But the Taliban have so far refused direct contact with the council, which they see as being too close to Hamid Karzai’s government.

The children were asleep in their beds upstairs in the house in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, when the fire broke out at the semi-detached house in the early hours of Friday.

article-17016.xml,"The Afghan president has announced that security control of a large section of the country is to be transferred to Afghan hands. Meanwhile, growing calls for troop withdrawal from allied nations may leave the US holding the bag in the conflict.
Hamid Karzai’s announcement to push ahead with the five-stage power transfer will bring 122 more districts across Afghanistan under local security’s jurisdiction, making Afghan forces responsible for the protection of 75 percent of the population.
The latest swathe of the country to be transferred includes the Uruzgan province, where most of the Australian coalition troops are currently in action.
US President Barack Obama hailed the move as an “important step” in the US-Afghan security transition, in which the American government has pledged to hand over complete security control to Afghanistan by 2014.
The Afghan government has said this next stage of the security handover could take as little as six months. NATO estimates differ, putting the transition time at 12-18 months.
The ranks of Afghan security forces currently stand at 350,000, but there are still 130,000 NATO coalition troops active in the ongoing fight against insurgency in the country.
The Afghanistan campaign has faced declining popularity with more nations resolving to accelerate the withdrawal of their troops.
Australia announced an early withdrawal of troops in April, pledging to pull all forces out of the country by the end of 2013. While newly elected French president Francois Hollande said during his campaign that he would push to have France’s soldiers withdrawn by the end of 2012.
This dwindling support for the war is bad news for the US, which has pledged annual financial backing of $4.1 billion to Afghanistan after signing the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) at the beginning of May.
The NATO summit in Chicago on May 20 will see President Obama pushing for the allied nations to front a quarter of the costs of financing the Afghan forces, equating to around $1 billion a year.
However, this target may be overly ambitious given the backdrop of worsening financial crisis in Europe and growing calls to withdraw allied troops as soon as possible.
John Rees from the Stop the War coalition told RT that ten years of war are having a disastrous effect on all the countries involved.
“The clearest way to bring that to an end, the clearest way to stop the war spilling over the Afghan borders into other countries is to end the occupation now. The advice that should be given to all the major powers that are at work in Afghanistan is to get out of it,” Rees told RT.
Meanwhile, the assassination of top Afghan peace-negotiator Maulvi Arsala Rahmani in Kabul on Sunday has dealt a significant blow to talks with the Taliban.
Taliban defector Rahmani used his strong ties with the terrorist movement to reach out to its commanders. His death has been described as a “huge loss to Afghanistan” by President Karzai’s spokesperson Aimal Faizi.
The Taliban have denied any involvement in Rahmani’s killing, although they had previously said they would target peace negotiators.
Western neglect of Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal brought about a growth of terror in the country, Afghan President Hamid Karzai believes. This in turn led to both 9/11, and terror attacks in Russia, he insists.

Greece's two traditionally dominant parties, New Democracy and the Socialist PASOK were hammered on May 6, as the bailed-out country suffers through a fifth year of recession, with more than one in five Greeks out of work.
Since the election, Syriza has gained support, and in a survey published Monday led with a projected 20.5 percent of public support, pushing New Democracy to second place with 19.4 percent, while PASOK was third with 11.8 percent. No margin of error was given in the Rass poll of 1,002 people, conducted May 10-11 for the Eleftheros Typos newspaper.
New Democracy and PASOK could form a government without Syriza, but the small Democratic Left party that would provide the required support is insisting that such a coalition would be unworkable.

A lieutenant who had defected was also killed in the clashes.
Regime forces launched an offensive on Rastan at the weekend but met with sharp resistance from rebels seeking the ouster of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
The Observatory said dozens had been wounded in shelling of the city by Syrian troops. The bombardment by regime forces resumed following the deadly clashes, it added.
In Quraya in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, a 15-year-old boy was killed by machinegun fire as regime forces raided the town, the Observatory said, bringing the total number of people killed on Monday to 25.
The watchdog added that 15 residents of the city were arrested.
And in the capital Damascus, regime forces raided the neighborhood of Qaboon, while snipers were stationed on the roofs of some buildings.
The watchdog said 45 people — 25 civilians, 15 soldiers and five rebels — were killed in a surge of violence in various flashpoints on Sunday, despite a ceasefire brokered by UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan that was supposed to take effect on April 12.
Among the dead were a Shiite imam, Sheikh Abbas al-Laham, who leads the prayers in the Ruqayya mosque in Damascus, a revered place of pilgrimage for many religious Iranians. The cleric was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Damascus, the Observatory said.

NASA astronaut Joseph Acaba, veteran cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin, who is departing on his maiden space flight, launched in clear skies aboard the Soyuz TMA-04M rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Monday night.
Three minutes into the flight, the crew members gave a thumbs-up signal to a camera on board the capsule. An anchor inside Mission Control outside Moscow told assembled scientists and students that the three astronauts were feeling well.
The trio will berth early on Wednesday, joining Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, NASA's Don Pettit and European Space Agency astronaut Andre Kuipers aboard the ISS, a $100 billion research complex orbiting about 240 miles above Earth.
Since the retirement of the space shuttles last year, the United States is dependent on Russia to fly astronauts to the ISS, which costs the nation $60 million per person.
Moscow hopes a smooth mission will begin to restore confidence in its once-pioneering space program after a string of launch mishaps last year, including the failure of a mission touted as post-Soviet Russia's interplanetary debut.
Tuesday's flight was delayed from March 30 to allow Russia's partly state-owned space contractor, RKK Energia, to prepare a new capsule for launch after an accident during pressure tests damaged the Soyuz crew capsule.
The previous crew of three at the ISS returned from the station in late April, following a delay due to safety fears after an unmanned Russian Progress craft taking supplies to the station broke up in the atmosphere in August.

article-1857.xml,"Independent monitors called for tighter oversight of Egypt's parliamentary election on Tuesday as Egyptians voted in staggered run-offs hotly contested by rival Islamist groups seeking to extend their early gains.
Hardline Salafis were the surprise runners-up behind the well-established Muslim Brotherhood's party in last week's opening stage, the biggest test of the public mood since street protests ended Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule in February.
The three-phase vote ending in January could give Islamists a popular mandate to challenge the ruling army council, which has already been pushed by protesters to hand power to civilians in mid-2012, sooner than it had envisaged.
But Islamists are not united and may not line up to form a majority bloc in parliament, giving liberals scope to take part in a post-election government and shape the future constitution.
The Salafi al-Nour Party and the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) are contesting about half of the 52 seats up for grabs in Monday and Tuesday's run-off votes for seats where no candidate won more than 50 percent in the first round.
There have been none of the long queues of voters that accompanied the first round vote. But, as before, party supporters have rallied voters outside polling stations and campaigned on the streets in violation of election rules.
"";Until now we haven't seen a positive move to limit this phenomenon. It was widespread in the first stage and should have vanished in the run-offs, but it remains visible in front of the polling stations,"" said Tarek Zaghloul, executive manager at the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, involved in monitoring.
He also noted that parties were using religious slogans, also banned, in their campaigning and bussing voters in.
The election committee has noted violations and vowed to act but said irregularities did not undermine the election's legitimacy, echoing an assessment made by independent monitors.
But the committee raised eyebrows by revising its original first-round turnout figure of 62 percent down to 52 percent.
A court also ruled results for one of four constituencies in Cairo were void after ballot boxes were damaged or went missing.
Islamist rivalry
Monitors Without Borders, another independent group watching the poll, urged the committee to "";swiftly address administrative and organisational mistakes in the election process for the second day of the run-offs and take urgent steps to provide the appropriate climate for the counting process"".
The committee has said it wants votes to be counted at polling stations not at a central location to avoid mishandling.  Results could be announced as early as late on Tuesday.
Some of the fiercest run-offs are in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, an Islamist stronghold.
"";There were attempts to unite, but Salafis are very difficult,"" said Mohamed Hussein, 20, as he distributed leaflets for the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in front of a polling station on Monday in Alexandria. 
"";We may agree on certain things but we are different in vision and strategy,"" he said. "";It is easier for me to talk with a liberal or a socialist than a Salafi.""
After the first round, the FJP's party list won 36.6 percent of valid votes, with al-Nour's list winning 24.4 percent and a liberal Egyptian Bloc on 13.4 percent, based on figures published by the election committee before it revised turnout.
Work on the constitution could be a major battleground among the new parliamentarians and between the assembly and the army, which angered politicians when its cabinet made proposals before the vote to shield the army from civilian oversight.
Though Islamists dominate, they range from hardline Salafis - who want to stop visitors wearing bikinis on beaches and ban alcohol - to centrists. Liberals will also have a significant voice.
Alongside the Egyptian Bloc and other groups that fielded separate lists, one fifth of the FJP's list is made up of a variety of smaller parties that include the liberal al-Ghad (Tomorrow) party and the left-leaning Karama (Dignity).
Under a complex system, two-thirds of the 498 elected lower house seats go proportionately to party lists, with the rest going to individual candidates."

Electoral officials in Congo struggled to finish counting votes from last week’s presidential election on Tuesday, sending  helicopters to remote polling stations to try to meet a midnight deadline as street tensions rose.
A delay in issuing full preliminary results from the vote in the vast central African state could further complicate an election already marred by deadly violence, logistical problems and allegations of fraud.
“We want to keep to the date of December 6, but we’ve had some logistical problems, these have hampered us,” electoral body spokesman Mathieu Mpita said by telephone. “If we don’t have the maximum initial tallies, we will release partial results.”
The electoral commission set the deadline for a full preliminary count for Dec. 6, the fifth anniversary of President Joseph Kabila’s inauguration, and the day the opposition says  marks the end of his constitutional term.
U.N.-led diplomatic efforts are under way to allow a delay to the results if needed, according to sources.
Partial preliminary results issued so far, representing nearly 70% of the ballots cast, give Kabila a 10-point lead over his chief rival, Etienne Tshisekedi. The opposition has said it will reject the outcome.
At least 18 people have been killed in election-related violence so far, according to US-based Human Rights Watch, and a senior member of Kabila’s camp said the government would have to call in the army if protests become “too chaotic”.
Banks closing
There was a heavy security presence on the streets of the capital on Tuesday, and some residents piled into boats to cross the Congo River into neighbouring Congo Republic, fearing renewed violence after the results.
Banks across the city were shutting early and the city’s normally chaotic central market was quiet.
“I have my normal clients, but they aren’t here. I don’t know if they are scared,” said Rose Nsele, sitting next to a pile of manioc leaves she had been unable to sell.
The first locally organised and funded election since the official end of years of war in 2003 that killed 5,4 million people was meant to offer hope of greater stability.
But fears are mounting that a rejection of the results will unleash bloodshed. Veteran opposition leader Tshisekedi enjoys broad support in Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people.
Congo’s election commission defied all odds to hold the presidential and parliamentary vote last week. Often chaotic and at times violent, voting had to be stretched over three days due to delays in places.
International observers say the various steps of the counting process after the initial tally at polling stations had been poorly organised, with ballots and results sheets often lost or destroyed in the process.
Joseph Kabila succeeded his father, Laurent Kabila, who was shot dead by a bodyguard in 2001. He won U.N.-sponsored elections in 2006, promising he would bring an end to a decade of war and chaos. But his government has struggled against local and foreign rebel groups in the east and Congo remains among the most risky countries in which to do business."
article-19380.xml,"The Legion of Christ religious order has been hit by the second scandal in a week with the admission that its most well-known priest - a prominent author, lecturer and television personality - had fathered a child.
The Rev Thomas Williams said in a statement he was ""deeply sorry for this grave transgression"" against his vows of celibacy and would be taking a year off to reflect on what he had done.
The statement was issued after reporters confronted the Legion with the allegation lodged by a Spanish association of Legion victims accusing Rev Williams of having fathered a child.
The letter, sent to the Legion and Vatican several weeks ago, also named other Legion priests accused of sexually abusing minors.
Rev Williams, who was not accused of abuse, said ""a number of years ago"" he had a relationship with a woman and fathered her child. He did not identify the mother or say whether the relationship had continued.
The Legion has been beset by scandals for years following revelations that its late founder, the Rev Marciel Maciel, fathered three children and sexually abused his seminarians. Rev Maciel died in 2008 and in 2009 the Legion admitted to his crimes.
Rev Williams, the most prominent priest in the 800-strong order, spoke about Rev Maciel's double life in a February 2009 interview with the Catholic ETWN programme, saying the revelations were a ""very, very hard blow to all of us.""
Rev Williams, who is the author of such books as the 2008 book Knowing Right From Wrong on Christian moral conscience, was the superior of the Legion's general directorate in Rome in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More recently, he has taught theology, promoted his books and lectured.
The accusation against Rev Williams was first lodged for Help of Those Affected by the LC, a Spanish association for victims of the Legion, which several weeks ago sent a list of accused Legion priests to the superior in Rome, Fr Alvaro Corcuera and the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
The Legion admitted on Friday that it had referred seven priests to the Vatican who were accused of sexually abusing minors."
article-19388.xml,"A new lawyer for OJ Simpson has filed a new attempt to gain his release from Nevada state prison, alleging the former American football star and actor was so badly represented by lawyers in his trial and previous appeals that he deserves a retrial.
A 94-page document filed in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas faults the trial strategy and performance of attorneys Yale Galanter of Miami and Gabriel Grasso of Las Vegas, but maintains Simpson's same basic defence.
It says the National Football League Hall of Famer wanted to recover from sports memorabilia dealers family photos and personal mementoes stolen from him after his 1995 acquittal in the Los Angeles deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was convicted in 2008 in Las Vegas of charges including kidnapping and armed robbery in a caper in a casino hotel room crammed with two memorabilia dealers and a middle man, Simpson and five others later convicted of felonies.
Simpson, 64, was sentenced in December 2008 to nine to 33 years behind bars. He is the only one in the case still in prison.
The filing, called a writ of habeas corpus, is a common next-step appeals strategy to blame trial and initial appeals attorneys for a defendant's conviction. If state courts deny it, it can be appealed against to federal courts.
Almost all of the 22 grounds that lawyer Patricia Palm of Las Vegas cited in the document fault Mr Galanter and Mr Grasso. Ms Palm is due to argue the case on July 3 in Clark County District Court in Las Vegas.
The first claim is that Mr Galanter had a conflict of interest so severe he should have removed himself from the case. It does not raise a similar contention against Mr Grasso.
Mr Galanter declined comment, saying he wanted to read the complete document and supporting appendices. Mr Grasso said he had not read the document, but ""I'm behind OJ and I hope this petition helps him get out of prison"".
Simpson's current private lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne, declined comment."

The CBI has been asked to submit its preliminary report by August 3.  The raids come in the wake of the CBI registering a case against  Yeddyurappa and others in line with the May 11 Supreme Court directive ordering a probe by the central agency into alleged undue favours shown by him to firms involved in illegal mining in lieu of donations to a charitable trust run by his kin when he was the chief minister.  The raids began at 6.15am and would continue throughout the day, the sources said.

article-19597.xml,"A team of international observers that came under fire in northern Syria was apparently stranded in the area overnight, and United Nations officials said Wednesday they hope to evacuate the group within hours.
A roadside bomb struck the team's vehicles Tuesday during a mission in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun, but none of the observers was wounded. The attack, which came minutes after witnesses said regime forces gunned down mourners at a funeral procession nearby, dealt a fresh blow to international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan.
Activists said the violence continued Wednesday with regime forces opening fire from the outskirts of Khan Sheikhoun.
Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group, said the heavy machine-gun fire has so far prevented people from holding funerals for some of the 20 mourners who were killed at the funeral a day earlier.
The U.N. said rebel forces had given the observers shelter in the town, which has witnessed anti-government protests since an uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March last year.
Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the U.N. team, told reporters Wednesday that he had spoken with the observers in Khan Sheikhoun by telephone and that they ""told us that they are happy and safe where they are.""
Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, said in a statement that the mission will recover the six staff members later Wednesday. ""The U.N. staff members are co-located with opposition elements ... and are reportedly being treated well.""
Fawzi said the observers were caught up in the explosion as they met with the rebel Free Syrian Army. He said three vehicles were damaged.
More than 200 U.N. observers have been deployed throughout Syria to monitor a cease-fire agreement that has been repeatedly violated by both sides since it took effect on April 12.
Tuesday's attack was at least the second time the U.N. observers have been caught up in Syria's violence. Last week, a roadside bomb struck a Syrian military truck in the south of the country just seconds after Mood rode by in a convoy.
It was not clear who was behind the blast and no one claimed responsibility.
A video posted by activists online appeared to show the exact moment the U.N. vehicle was struck. The video shows two white vehicles clearly marked ""U.N"" with people milling around it, and two others parked a few meters (yards) behind. Slippers apparently left behind by the mourners running away from the shooting earlier are seen strewn about on the ground.
The blast blew off the front of the first vehicle and sent up a plume of smoke as people screamed and frantically ran for cover. The four cars are then seen slowly driving away.
It was not clear how close the observers were to the funeral shootings, but if confirmed, a regime attack on civilians directly in front of the observer mission could put pressure on them to describe publicly what they are seeing in Syria. They report back to the U.N. but have not publicized their findings.
Syria's state-run TV, meanwhile, reported Wednesday that authorities released 250 people who were involved in the uprising. Assad has issued several pardons releasing thousands of detainees since the crisis began.
The Observatory also said Syrian forces opened fire at the Naziheen Palestinian refugee camp in the southern city of Daraa, killing four people. The pro-government TV station Ikhbariyah blamed members of ""an armed terrorist group,"" saying they fired two rocket-propelled grenades at the camp, killing a 4-year-old girl and wounding 15 other people.
The Syrian uprising began with mostly peaceful protests calling for change, but a relentless government crackdown led many in the opposition to take up arms. Some soldiers also have switched sides and joined forces with the rebels.
The U.N. estimates the conflict has killed more than 9,000 people.

Somali police appeared to make a deadly error when they returned a suspected suicide car bomber they had arrested to his vehicle, where he then detonated a blast that killed four people, officials and witnesses have said.
Ali Muse, the head of the city's ambulance service, said the blast killed three civilians, while shopkeeper Abdiqadir Abdulahi said he saw one dead policeman as well.
Al-Shabab militants have stepped up a campaign of roadside bombs and suicide car bomb attacks in Mogadishu in recent weeks. The militants were almost entirely pushed out of the Somali capital earlier this year in an offensive by African Union forces.
The latest blast, which happened on Tuesday near the former Egyptian embassy, sent a plume of smoke over the city and the remains of the car burned long after the explosion.
A policeman, Abdi Hassan, said the would-be bomber was intercepted hours before the blast and arrested. But Hassan said police returned the attacker to his bomb-laden vehicle under orders to disarm the explosives. Instead, he was able to trigger the bomb.

A Malaysian court has convicted three Mexican brothers and two other people and sentenced them to be hanged for drug trafficking.
The Mexicans are from Sinaloa state, the cradle of their country's drug trade, but have no criminal record at home.
They were arrested at a secluded drug-making factory in 2008 and claimed they had been cleaning the place, not making drugs.
Kuala Lumpur High Court Judge Mohamad Zawawi Salleh ruled the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and imposed the death sentence, the mandatory penalty for drug trafficking in Malaysia. The other defendants are a Singaporean and a Malaysian.
""The court finds all five accused are aware and are involved in the activity of drug-making,"" Mohamad Zawawi said, adding that the verdict should be a warning to potential drug offenders.
""We are very sad. We thought we would be acquitted,"" said the eldest brother, Luis Alfonso Gonzales.
The court had previously rejected the defence's contention that some evidence discrepancies amounted to tampering after a chemist testified that seven items he received for analysis looked different from what he had seen at the factory.
The prosecution denied there was any manipulation that undermined the trial.
At the factory where the men were arrested, police found more than 29 kilograms of methamphetamine worth 44 million ringgit (15 million US dollars).
Judge Mohamed Zawawi said it was clear the men were arrested at an illegal drug laboratory. Traces of drug chemicals were on their clothes, and their claim to have been cleaning the place was not logical because stains were also found on their underwear, he said."

article-21224.xml,"President Barack Obama on Thursday declared a new chapter in U.S. relations with Myanmar, easing an investment ban and naming the first U.S. ambassador to the former pariah state in 22 years to reward it for democratic reforms.
Myanmar's reforms over the past year or so have seen it emerge from decades of authoritarian rule and diplomatic isolation, although it remains dominated by its military. Obama pointed to the parliamentary election of opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi as a prominent example of progress in the Asian nation also known as Burma.
After meeting Myanmar's Foreign Minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the U.S. was suspending sanctions on American investment across all sectors of the Myanmar economy and export of financial services. She described it as the most significant action Washington has taken so far to reward Myanmar for its reforms.
""Today we say to American businesses, invest in Burma, and do it responsibly,"" she told a joint news conference after talks with the foreign minister at the State Department. She said U.S. companies would be expected to conduct due diligence to avoid any problems, including human rights abuses.
Despite the easing of restrictions, U.S. companies would still be barred from doing business with firms associated with the country's powerful military, and the White House announced it was keeping its framework of hard-hitting sanctions in place for now, saying Myanmar's democratic reforms are still ""nascent.""
The move was welcomed by two Republican senators influential on Myanmar policy, John McCain and Mitch McConnell, who both met with Wunna Maung Lwin Thursday.
They also welcomed the nomination of Derek Mitchell, who will become the first U.S. ambassador to the country since 1990. Clinton urged his quick confirmation by the Senate. The U.S. is currently represented by a lower-level diplomat.
Myanmar will also send a full ambassador to Washington, a post to be taken by its current permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Than Swe.
Human rights groups and exiled Myanmar activists criticized the announcement on the easing on economic controls.
The U.S. Coalition for Burma said the Obama administration was prematurely rewarding Myanmar while its military was escalating violence against the Kachin ethnic minority in the north of the country. The fighting over the past year has displaced tens of thousands of villagers.
Clinton voiced continued concern over detention of political prisoners. Western governments say hundreds of such detainees are still held despite a series of amnesties granted by Myanmar's President Thein Sein over the past year.
The Obama administration had announced after democracy leader Suu Kyi's election in April that it planned to ease a ban on American investment that has been in place since 1997. That fueled intense debate in Washington on how and at what pace the U.S. should ease policies that have long punished Myanmar country for rights abuses and suppression of democracy.
U.S. businesses and some lawmakers have been pushing to lift economic sanctions and point to the European Union's recent suspension of its restrictions, which could now leave American corporations at a competitive disadvantage - not least in the potentially lucrative oil, gas and mining sectors.
Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of the previous 22 years under house arrest before her release in late 2010, this week gave cautious backing to the suspension of economic sanctions but warned that the reforms in Myanmar were still reversible.
Human Rights Watch is demanding the imposition of binding rules on corporate responsibility for U.S. companies working in Myanmar and revision of a blacklist of sanctioned Myanmar entities - which U.S. officials say is underway. Many of them, both individuals and companies, are linked to the military, and U.S. firms will still be barred from working with those entities.
A senior administration official said the U.S. government would develop a mechanism to ensure transparency and oversight in American business dealings in Myanmar, but the standards would not be legally binding.
The official, who was briefing reporters on condition of anonymity to provide details of the new U.S. policies, also cautioned that Myanmar was not currently a very welcoming place for foreign businesses, because of the human rights situation, corruption and the rudimentary legal and regulatory environment.

article-2124.xml,"The Rev. Billy Graham was released from hospital Tuesday after spending six days recovering from pneumonia, his second bout with the lung infection in the past seven months.
Doctors decided to let the 93-year-old evangelist go home after he responded well to antibiotics and physical therapy to increase his strength, said Nancy Lindell, a spokeswoman for Mission Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina.
Graham said he was grateful for the thoughts and prayers from around the world, according to a statement released by the hospital.
""I also appreciated the wonderful treatment I received here from such caring doctors and nurses, and feel I have made some new friends,"" Graham said. ""But I am especially looking forward to seeing my home decorated for Christmas and spending the holidays with members of my family.""
Graham was admitted Nov. 30 after suffering from congestion, a cough and slight fever. He was diagnosed with pneumonia.
He spent five days at the hospital with the same ailment in May. In October 2008, Graham was hospitalized after he tripped and fell over one of his dogs. Earlier that same year, he had elective surgery on a shunt that controls excess fluid on his brain. The shunt was first installed in 2000 and drains fluid through a small tube, relieving excess pressure that can cause symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.
Graham has also suffered from prostate cancer and was hospitalized in 2007 for nearly two weeks after experiencing intestinal bleeding. His wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in June 2007.

article-21273.xml,"Medical examiners found evidence of marijuana in Trayvon Martin's system after he was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer, an autopsy report released Thursday shows.
Also included in a massive release of evidence was an investigator's recommendation to prosecutors that suspect George Zimmerman be arrested on manslaughter charges. The investigator, who was on the scene after the shooting, wrote on March 13 that the confrontation should have been avoided. That report came nearly a month before Zimmerman was arrested.
The package of documents, photos and video was turned over by prosecutors to defense attorneys days before it was released to the media.
The autopsy says medical examiners found THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, when they tested Martin's blood and urine. A police report shows Martin had been shot once in the chest and had been pronounced dead at the scene.
Also in the package is a photo of suspect George Zimmerman with a bloody nose taken the night of the fight. A paramedic report says Zimmerman had a 1-inch laceration on his head and forehead abrasion.
""Bleeding tenderness to his nose, and a small laceration to the back of his head. All injuries have minor bleeding,"" paramedic Michael Brandy wrote about Zimmerman's injuries in the report.
Zimmerman told a police officer that he did not have any other bruises or cuts but his back hurt, according to a police report.
Whether Zimmerman was injured in the Feb. 26 altercation with Martin has been a key question. Zimmerman has claimed self-defense and said he only fired because the unarmed teenager attacked him.
Zimmerman is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge. He has pleaded not guilty.
Investigator Christopher Serino, who recommended that Zimmerman be charged, told prosecutors in March that the fight could have been avoided if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement. He said Zimmerman, after leaving his vehicle, could have identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and talked to him instead of confronting him.
He said there is no evidence Martin was involved in any criminal activity.
A separate report written by Serino at the crime scene says Martin had $40.15, Skittles candy, a red lighter, headphones and a photo pin in his pocket. He had been shot once in the chest and had been pronounced dead at the scene.
New witness accounts also emerged Thursday. A witness, whose name is redacted, told investigators he saw ""a black male, wearing a dark colored hoodie,"" on top of a white or Hispanic male who was yelling for help.
The witness, who was looking out the sliding glass door at his home about 30 feet away, said he saw the black male throwing punches ""MMA (mixed martial arts) style.""
He said he told the fighters he was calling the police. He said that as he was making the call, he heard a shot. He looked outside and saw the person who had been on top laid out on the grass as if he had been shot. He said the other fighter was standing on the sidewalk, talking to another person with a flashlight.

article-2209.xml,"
Dozens of bodies were dumped in the streets of a Syrian city at the heart of the country’s nine-month-old uprising, a grim sign that sectarian bloodshed is escalating.
The discovery in the streets of Homs came as the United States stepped up pressure on the regime of President Bashar Assad to end its crackdown on the anti-government protests.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met in Geneva with Syrian opposition figures and Washington said it was sending its ambassador back to Damascus.
Up to 50 people were killed in Homs on Monday, but details about what happened in Syria’s third-largest city only came to light today with reports of retaliatory attacks pitting members of the Alawite sect against Sunnis.
The sectarian violence is a dire development in Syria, and one that opposition members say plays directly into the regime’s hands.
Since the uprising began, Mr Assad portrayed himself as the lone force who can ward off the radicalism and sectarianism that have bedevilled neighbours in Iraq and Lebanon.
Opposition figures have accused Mr Assad’s minority Alawite regime of trying to stir up trouble with the Sunni majority to blunt enthusiasm for the uprising.
“It was an insane escalation,” activist Mohamed Saleh said by telephone from Homs. “There were kidnappings and killings in a mad way. People are afraid to go out of their homes.”
Thirty-four of the dead were shot execution-style, their bodies dumped in a public square, according to Mr Saleh and others who monitor the violence, including the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A Homs government official confirmed only that 43 bodies were found on Monday in Homs.
With 4,000 people dead across Syria in the uprising, the conflict is no longer just a matter of government forces firing on peaceful protesters looking to topple Mr Assad’s autocratic regime.
The government also has been facing strong resistance from army defectors who have taken refuge in Homs. But sectarian overtones are building as well, because the uprising has unearthed long-simmering grievances that are now exploding into violence.
The Arab League has piled on economic sanctions to try to end the violence, adding to measures already taken by the US, European Union, Turkey and others.

Mansor Almaribe, 45, was found guilty of blasphemy after he was arrested last month in Medina while on a pilgrimage, Australian officials said.
It's unclear what Almaribe, a Shia Muslim from Victoria state, said or did to get arrested.
""The ambassador has urgently contacted Saudi authorities and will make strong representations, including to key figures in the Saudi government, seeking leniency,"" said Kate Sieper, a foreign affairs spokeswoman.
Family members said they are worried about his health.
""He is sick, and he has back injuries and he has diabetes,"" his son, Issam Almaribe, told CNN affiliate 9 News Australia.
Consular officials have contacted Almaribe several times by phone since his arrest in mid-November, and were in the courtroom during the reading of the verdict.
Australian officials said they were informed he was convicted of blasphemy and ""making comments insulting to prophet Mohammed's relatives.""
His sentence was originally two years imprisonment along with the 500 lashes, but the court reduced the sentence by a year, consular officials said. It was unclear when the lashing punishment will be carried out.
Blasphemy is punishable by up to a death sentence under the strict Muslim law in Saudi Arabia."

article-24804.xml,"At least two people were killed in Beirut in heavy clashes early on Monday between rival Sunni Muslim gunmen, the latest violence fuelled by tensions over the uprising in neighboring Syria.
Gunmen firing rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns clashed in the Lebanese capital's Tariq al-Jadideh district in some of the fiercest battles since sectarian fighting four years ago brought Lebanon back to the brink of civil war.
The violence followed the killing of two members of a political alliance opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Sunday in the north of Lebanon.
Residents in the northern region of Akkar blocked roads and burned tyres to protest against the killing and demonstrations spread south to the main coastal highway and to Beirut, where several roads were cut off.
A Reuters cameraman in Tariq al-Jadideh said shooting could be heard from 10 pm (1900 GMT) until nearly 5 am (0200 GMT) on Monday.
Security sources said the fighting pitted gunmen from the Future Movement, loyal to anti-Syrian former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, against the pro-Syrian Arab Movement Party headed by Shaker Barjawi.
The state news agency said two people were killed and 18 wounded. The security sources put the death toll at three - two of Barjawi's supporters and one from the Future Movement - with nine people wounded.
Many of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims sympathize with Syria's Sunni-led uprising against Assad, whose father sent forces into Lebanon during its 1975-1990 civil war. The Syrian army finally pulled out in 2005 under international pressure.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on Sunday: ""The government is determined to continue to shoulder its national responsibilities amid this critical period in Lebanon and the region, and it will take all measures necessary to preserve civil peace.""

Speaking to ABC's Barbara Walters in a rare interview that aired Wednesday, President Bashar Assad maintained he did not give a command ""to kill or be brutal.""
""They're not my forces,"" Assad responded when asked if Syrian troops had cracked down too hard on protesters. ""They are military forces (who) belong to the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country.""
In fact, in his role as president, Assad is the commander of Syria's armed forces.
The U.N. estimates more than 4,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began in March.
""Who said the United Nations is a credible institution?"" Assad said, when Walters asked him about allegations of widespread violence and torture.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Assad was trying to shirk responsibility.
""I find it ludicrous that he is attempting to hide behind some sort of shell game but also some sort of claim that he doesn't exercise authority in his own country,"" Toner said.
Assad has responded with once-unthinkable promises of reform in one of the most authoritarian states in the Middle East. But he simultaneously unleashed the military to crush the protests with tanks and snipers.
Still, he insisted he still had the support of Syrians.
""If you don't have the support of the people you cannot be in this position,"" he said. ""Syria is not easy ... it is a very difficult country to govern if you don't have the public support.""

""We have been registering many aftershocks since then,"" she added.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damages but the jolt was felt very strongly on the top floors of buildings in Sofia.

More than 20 NATO supply trucks have been destroyed in an attack in southern Pakistan.
Insurgents armed with rockets and automatic weapons opened fire on a transport terminal in the south western city of Quetta.
Several oil tankers exploded before fire spread to other trucks parked nearby.
Firefighters and ambulance crews were called to the scene.
Paramilitary soldiers cordoned off the site as firefighters battled the massive blaze, with flames shooting high into the night sky and thick black smoke billowing from the burning trucks.
Senior police official Malik Arshad said gunmen fired bullets and a rocket at the oil tankers.
""Flames were rising from more than 20 vehicles. We do not know about any casualties yet because the blaze is still so huge,"" he said, adding that 10 vehicles were safely evacuated from the terminal.
""First the fire started in two oil tankers and the fuel started leaking which spread the fire to other vehicles.""

article-3291.xml,"Hundreds of people took to the streets in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad Thursday, to protest the NATO airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on Nov 26, NBC News reported.
Lawyers, union members, and others -- carrying Pakistani flag and signs reading ""Go America Go"" and ""We Condemn Nato Attack"" -- marched to the heavily-fortified diplomatic enclave. Police in riot gear stood behind barbed wire along parts of the route. A dummy marked ""Nato"" was burned outside the Parliament building.
A police official told Agence France Presse that 500 policemen were deployed around the diplomatic enclave to prevent any violence.
The protest came after assailants earlier torched more than 20 tankers in Pakistan carrying fuel for U.S. and NATO troops in neighboring Afghanistan on Thursday, in the first reported attack since Islamabad closed the border to protest coalition airstrikes.
Several hundred trucks have been stranded at poorly guarded terminals around the country as they wait for Pakistan to reopen its two border crossings into Afghanistan. Around 40 percent of the non-lethal supplies for U.S.-led troops in landlocked Afghanistan travel across Pakistani soil.
Islamabad closed both frontier crossings into Afghanistan on Nov. 26, hours after airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition killed 24 Pakistani troops on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. U.S. and NATO officials have said the incident was a mistake, and have pledged to investigate.
Police officer Hamid Shakil says unknown men fired rockets at a terminal for the tankers close to the southwestern city of Quetta. He said at least 23 tankers were set ablaze. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Last year, Islamabad temporarily closed one of its Afghan crossings to NATO supplies after U.S. helicopters accidentally killed two Pakistani soldiers. Suspected militants or criminals took advantage of the impasse to launch many attacks against stranded or rerouted trucks carrying NATO supplies.
The deadly airstrikes at the border sent already tense relations between Pakistan and the United States to new lows, threatening Islamabad's cooperation in helping negotiate an end to the Afghan war.
It came amid political tensions in Islamabad following the resignation of Pakistan's ambassador to the United States following an outcry from the country's powerful military establishment, which is in charge of Afghan and U.S. policy. Envoy Husain Haqqani stepped down because of allegations he wrote a memo to Washington asking for its help to stop a supposed military coup.

Two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen will be tried according to Indian law, deputy foreign minister Preneet Kaur has said.
She spoke after talks with her Italian counterpart Steffan de Mistura.
The two marines were on board an Italian oil tanker off southern India.
Italy says as the incident took place in international waters the men should be tried in Italy. Officials say the fishing boat was behaving aggressively and was mistaken for a pirate vessel.
Italian officials have asked the High Court in the state of Kerala to throw out the murder charges against the two marines.
The marines were detained on Sunday and remanded in custody for two weeks as the murder investigation against them continues.
""As far as the law point is concerned,"" Ms Kaur said, ""they have their interpretations and we have our interpretations.
""As of today, the two people [Italian marines] are on Indian soil and tomorrow the Indian court is going to decide what steps are to be taken further,"" she said.
""So far as we are concerned in India, we certainly will go by our law.""
Mr Mistura expressed his regret over the two Indian fishermen's deaths, but said there were legal points that needed to be clarified, including the exact position of the ship when the two men died.
""We do acknowledge that two Indian citizens died... and we are terribly sad. The second one is that is that the incident took place in international waters and at the same time the investigations will assert the exact position,"" he said.
""We all want the truth,"" he added.
Italy's defence ministry has said the fishing boat was behaving aggressively and ignored warning shots fired from the Italian oil tanker.
They said they opened fire after mistaking the fishermen for pirates. India said the fishermen were unarmed.
The incident took place off the coast of Kerala last Wednesday.
It sparked a major diplomatic row between the two countries. The Italian foreign ministry has said Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi will also visit Delhi next week to discuss the issue.
A delegation of experts from Italy's foreign, defence and justice ministries has already visited Delhi to discuss the case with Indian officials, but the two sides have so far been unable to resolve their differences.
The Italian foreign ministry also said that Indian police had taken ""coercive"" and ""unilateral"" action on Sunday when they escorted the two marines off the oil tanker where they were deployed as security guards and arrested them, news agency AFP reported.
Italy insists that its personnel cannot be charged under Indian law. It says the marines have immunity as the tanker was flying an Italian flag and was in international waters when the incident happened.
The marines have been identified as Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.

article-3736.xml,"Long-imprisoned Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's political party claimed victory Monday in parliamentary elections in Myanmar, a dramatic development in the southeast Asian country's efforts to end its international isolation.
The party said Monday it had won at least 43 out of the 44 seats that it contested -- including Suu Kyi's.
""This is not our triumph, this is a triumph of the people,"" Suu Kyi said as she arrived at the headquarters of the National League for Democracy in Yangon to meet with fellow candidates and other party members.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was already cautiously hailing the results of the voting on Sunday.
She told CNN she was ""very hopeful for the the people"" of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
""If this election goes as well as it is reported to have from the early reports, that would be a significant step,"" she said.
The official election results of Sunday's elections are expected sometime this week.
The NLD prediction was based on the party's own estimates, according to party member Thae Da Win Aung. It was still unclear whether the NLD had won the 44th seat, she said.
While control of parliament will not change even if the opposition wins all 44 seats, the vote itself marks an important step forward for many in the country who have lived under military rule for 50 years.
Suu Kyi, 66, led her party to a landslide victory the last time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. But the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest.
Released in November 2010, Suu Kyi was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the NLD for Sunday's race.
The United States announced in January that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar after the regime released political prisoners.
Clinton visited Myanmar in December -- a historic trip marking the first time a secretary of state had been to the country in more than 50 years -- and British Foreign Secretary William Hague visited the following month.
On Sunday Clinton said she had been impressed with her visit.
""I was very touched by the visit that I made and the commitments I received from members of the government who were quite sincere in their desire to move their country forward,"" she said, even as she underlined that the United States wanted to see ""continuing progress.""
The NLD fielded a candidate for every one of the 45 seats up for grabs. But the election commission rejected one candidate apparently because his parents had foreign residency. The NLD has said it plans to challenge his exclusion.
The government had promised the vote would be free and fair, and allowed international observers to monitor the polling.
On Sunday, the NLD said it had received more than 50 reports of voting irregularities.
Suu Kyi has said she has no regrets about taking part in the by-elections because the process has raised people's political awareness.
In front of hundreds of supporters and journalists gathered at the NLD headquarters Monday, Suu Kyi said she planned to push for more emphasis on the role of the people in governing the country. She said she would happily work with anybody who wanted national reconciliation.
Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling party, Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).
The 45 seats under contention in Sunday's elections were vacancies created by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year.
Still, the election was an opportunity for voters to weigh in during a time of enormous change in Myanmar.
Analysts said it was the first real test of the government's commitment to transition from military rule.
Two years ago, Myanmar staged a general election that was widely derided as a sham.
Several former military leaders formed the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) at the time to contest the election. Suu Kyi's party boycotted it.
After attracting international condemnation for manipulating the voting process in the 2010 race, Myanmar's leaders appear to have concluded that a fairer election will be proof to the world that the authorities can conduct a legitimate vote, experts said.
In the past 12 months, the country pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a ceasefire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Freer press rules have encouraged the proliferation of journals and magazines.
Myanmar's efforts to thaw its frosty relations with the rest of the world have been warmly welcomed and rewarded. In February, the European Union lifted a travel ban on Myanmar officials.
There have been hints, too, that a successful vote on Sunday would lead to the relatively swift unraveling of sanctions that have long choked the country's economy.
Thousands of Burmese living in exile around the world were watching the election for a clear sign that it is safe to return home.
As a member of parliament, Suu Kyi would be expected to be free to travel outside Myanmar -- and more importantly to return -- something that wasn't possible during her long years of repression and confinement."

Gusts of up to 150 kilometers per hour have been recorded in western Japan, with coastal areas likely seeing even stronger winds, Japan's weather agency said.
With the agency warning of possible tornadoes in the western half of Japan, airlines grounded over 550 flights and a number of train services were suspended.
An 81-year-old man died in central Toyama Prefecture when the wind blew over a shed, trapping him underneath, police said.
Forecasters said an expanding low pressure system in the Sea of Japan (East Sea) was forcing a cold front over the country, where it was bringing heavy rains and strong winds.
""This is like the core of a typhoon, but it is staying for a long time, whereas a typhoon usually moves rather quickly,"" a spokesman for the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
""Winds as strong as this are very rare,"" he said.
The meteorological agency said on its website the strong winds would move northwards into Wednesday, producing waves up to 10 meters high.
""In particular, ferocious winds are expected at sea (in the north) on the Sea of Japan side. Please be extremely wary of violent winds and high waves.""
The agency also warned heavy rain could trigger landslides and flooding.
Japan Airlines canceled 230 domestic and seven Asia-bound flights, affecting 31,600 passengers.
All Nippon Airways grounded 320 domestic flights, affecting 37,700 people.
East Japan Railways, which operates a vast train network in the eastern and northern regions, including Tokyo, canceled some commuter lines and a number of long-distance services.
The nation's main bullet train, linking Tokyo and Osaka, was experiencing delays after a brief suspension, but was running as of early evening.
At least 97 people suffered injuries across the country, knocked over by sudden gusts or hit by flying debris, national broadcaster NHK said.
A number of trucks were toppled by the winds, creating localised traffic jams in Toyama Prefecture.
NHK also reported a recently-constructed 10,000-ton tanker, which was moored off Ehime prefecture, had run aground.
Many companies sent employees home early. Canon told about 14,000 workers mostly in Tokyo and neighboring Kanagawa Prefecture to leave before the storm worsened.
""Most of them use public transportation to commute. The rain isn't so strong yet (in Tokyo) but the storm is likely to intensify and could disrupt train and other services,"" said company spokesman Hirotomo Fujimori, adding the early finish was to allow staff to get home.
